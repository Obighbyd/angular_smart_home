This project is a work in progress. The idea is:

- create a common dash that can be served by an esp8266 chip
- leverage angular to enable static html / js files.
- leverage a 'features.json' file to allow customisation of the dash.
- allow dash to send requests to other esp8266 devices on the local network.
- build versions for:
 - momentary actions (eg, catfeeder)
 - booleans (lamps/sockets) 
 - range actions (smart bulbs, led strings, etc).
