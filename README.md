This project is a work in progress. The idea is:

- DONE: create a common dash that can be served by an esp8266 chip
- DONE: leverage angular to enable static html / js files.
- DONE: leverage a 'features.json' file to allow customisation of the dash.
- DONE: allow dash to send requests to other esp8266 devices on the local network.
- build versions for:
 - IN PROGRESS: momentary actions (eg, catfeeder)
 - DONE: booleans (lamps/sockets) 
 - IN PROGRESS: range actions (smart bulbs, led strings, etc).
